Then, scan in the mesial direction, moving the scanner occlusally from the distal tooth over the prepared tooth to the mesial tooth. It is important to ensure that the coated sapphire disc of the scanner is at a distance of 0-20mm from the surface being measured, with the optimal distance being 2mm. The scanner should not be in contact with the teeth or the gums.', 'product': 'IFU Primescan Connect DE', 'sources': '40, 42, 43, 44, 45'}
